The project entails the development of a website aimed at students of the School of Mathematics at the ITCR. The website will provide a platform for students to engage in various activities, including making inquiries, accessing exercise examples, studying course materials, evaluating instructor-provided answers, and other functionalities related to the diverse range of courses offered by the school.

This tool will enable students to enhance their understanding of the field of mathematics, while also providing instructors with a centralized platform to address inquiries from the entire student body.
